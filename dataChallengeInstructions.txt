Instructions: 
Script written in Python, can be executed by calling 'python loanClassifier.py' at command line. Only precondition for running is that the script downloads CSVs into a local data directory in whatever home directory the file is being run, so the script should be called somewhere you don't mind a directory being automatically created and populated with the train/test CSVs.
